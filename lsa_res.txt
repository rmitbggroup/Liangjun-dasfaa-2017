@dougw I think you mean http://facebook.com/dougw
@1datarecovery straight in
@meatstack also make sure TomTom is fully chraged
@meatstack There's huge disagreement about FB too, in the photog community, because of the TOS.
@jlh_photo @JessicaHowerth in term of family foto, I would go back, because I don't want costco special hanging on my wall
@jlh_photo don't take negative connitations on the term "service" Lawyers, doctors, accoutnants are all "service"
@meatstack So clients who recognize the quality over the McDonald's photogs, will pay more or accept the reserved rights.
@meatstack Part of it is proper metadata management on the part of photogs. Check out the metadata on this photo http://tr.im/oycR
@jlh_photo they caught a shitton of flack over it. it was the reason I deleated my flickr stream, and deleted my account.
@meatstack Also, I should note, I generally provide stuff like B&W conversions for free to make sure that it's done right.
@jlh_photo I usually side with photog/artists rights but I may see @meatstack's point- if some1 commissioned a painting from an artist
@meatstack @jlh_photo I think it allcones down to what is agreed to INS contract (re paid clients)
@jen_k I've not had anyone ever have a problem with letting me use their photos for self-promotion though.
@jlh_photo yeah I thought that debate was interesting, changed my perspective a bit. It's all about what the market will allow for you.
@meatstack Well, "Rights" in generally is pretty broad
@meatstack Two photos: http://tr.im/ozB2 & http://tr.im/ozBr Art?
